# EngineKonzept

EngineKonzept is a new chess-engine repository built around latent adversarial planning.
It is intentionally **not** a conventional search engine with a neural add-on.

The target runtime path is:

`position -> encoder -> legality/policy proposer -> latent dynamics -> opponent module -> recurrent planner -> WDL + move selection -> UCI output`

## Current Scope

The repository now covers Phase 4:

- root project rules and execution plans
- Rust workspace boundaries and placeholder future crates
- Python training-project boundaries and placeholder modules
- exact symbolic chess primitives, position state, FEN support, legal move generation, move application, and perft coverage
- a minimal UCI shell with deterministic legal stub move output
- a factorized action space for model-facing move IO
- a deterministic object-centric position encoder
- a Python dataset pipeline with exact-rule labels, deterministic splits, and summary reporting
- CI, lint, and test wiring
- architecture and phase documentation

It still does **not** implement:

- model training or inference
- any search or evaluation runtime
- any learned proposer, dynamics, or planner model
- any classical engine/search machinery

## Validation Commands

From the repository root:

```bash
make check
```

Or run the individual commands directly:

```bash
cd rust && cargo fmt --all --check
cd rust && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cd rust && cargo test --workspace
python3 -m ruff check python
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m pytest python/tests
```

## Guardrails

- No alpha-beta, negamax, PVS, quiescence, TT-search, null-move pruning, LMR, or heuristic fallback engine.
- The symbolic chess core is allowed later only for exact rules, labels, tests, and final move safety checks.
- The current exact rules core is intentionally isolated from any runtime search logic.
- The current UCI shell is protocol-only and must not accrete classical engine behavior.
- The current action space and encoder are deterministic schema layers, not learned components.
- Runtime and protocol code belong in Rust.
- Training, datasets, and experiment code belong in Python.
- Every phase must leave the tree buildable, testable, and documented.
